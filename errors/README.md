A folder containing snippets of error occurring in code.
Main issues:
- Initialize error occurring when launching examples including wrench, as in example_kuka_kr6_force_control. It worked 5 of 10 times in the beginning, but now I constantly get error. See pictures.
- Not possible to bias or gravity compensate the wrench from netft_data in terminal. http://wiki.ros.org/netft_utils
